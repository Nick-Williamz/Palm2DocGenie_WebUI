Document Genie Says: Yes, it is possible to train a Lora on your own computer. You will need at least 8 GB of VRAM for this.

To train a Lora, you will need to use a tool called Kohya GUI. This tool has all the same settings as the trainer colab, so you can follow the guide in the link below.

You will also need to collect your images from Gelbooru and tag your dataset. You can use the WD1.4 Tagger extension for webui to do this.

Once you have collected and tagged your dataset, you can start training your Lora.

To learn more about training Loras, you can read the angry Lora training guide by ao.

Document Genie Says: The Canny edge detector is an edge detection operator that uses a multi-stage algorithm to detect edges in an image. The Canny edge detector was developed by John F. Canny in 1986. The Canny edge detector is a popular edge detector because it is able to detect both strong and weak edges in an image. The Canny edge detector is also able to suppress noise in an image. The Canny edge detector works by first applying a Gaussian blur to the image to reduce noise. The Gaussian blur is a low-pass filter that smooths out the image. After the Gaussian blur is applied, the image is converted to a grayscale image. The grayscale image is then used to calculate the gradient of the image. The gradient of the image is a measure of the change in intensity of the image from one pixel to the next. The gradient of the image is calculated by taking the first derivative of the image. The first derivative of the image is a measure of the change in intensity of the image from one pixel to the next. The gradient of the image is then used to find the edges in the image. The edges in the image are found by thresholding the gradient of the image. The gradient of the image is thresholded to find the pixels in the image that have a high gradient value. The pixels in the image that have a high gradient value are considered to be edges in the image. The Canny edge detector also applies a hysteresis threshold to the edges in the image. The hysteresis threshold is a threshold that is used to remove spurious edges from the image. The hysteresis threshold is a threshold that is used to remove spurious edges from the image.
